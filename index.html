                <h3>this is answer</h3>
                <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. 'CO' stands for corona, 'VI' for virus,
                    and
                    'D' for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as '2019 novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV.'

                <h2><span class="color-4">Can masks prevent the transmission of COVID-19?</span></h2>
                <h3>this is answer</h3>
                <p>Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and
                    save
                    lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against
                    COVID-19.</p>
